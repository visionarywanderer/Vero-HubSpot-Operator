# HubSpot Self-Improving Knowledge Base

## How This Works (Instructions for Claude)

### BEFORE Every Operation
1. **Read this entire file** before deploying any workflow, creating any property/pipeline/list, or installing any template
2. **Cross-check** your spec against the Quick Reference rules and the Learnings Log
3. **If a similar pattern exists** in the log, follow the documented fix — don't repeat the mistake

### AFTER a Failure
1. **Append a new entry** to the Learnings Log below with this format:
```
### YYYY-MM-DD — CATEGORY — Short Title
**Trigger:** What was being attempted
**Failed because:** Root cause (be specific — include field names, error messages)
**Fix:** What actually works (include code/JSON if helpful)
**Pattern:** One-line reusable rule for future reference
```
2. **If the failure was due to an unknown API format — Doc Check**: Before just retrying, use WebSearch to find the official HubSpot v4 API docs for the specific action/field that failed. Use WebFetch on the most relevant result to extract the correct format. If no docs help, use `list_workflows` to find an existing workflow on the same portal that uses the problematic action type and reverse-engineer the correct format. Include the source of the fix in the learnings entry.
3. **Update the Quick Reference** if this is a critical rule that prevents common failures
4. **Update `hubspot-connector` SKILL.md** if the discovery reveals action field formats not already documented
5. **Sanitize before saving** — replace any real portal IDs, owner IDs, or names with `{portal_id}`, `{owner_id}`, `{owner_name}` placeholders
6. **Copy this file** to `skills-package/hubspot-learnings/SKILL.md` to keep the shareable package in sync
7. **Offer to commit and deploy**: After appending, ask the user:
   "I've added a new learning. Want me to commit this to git, push, and deploy? This will update the app and skills-package for everyone."
   If they say yes, execute: create branch → commit → push → PR → wait for CI → merge → confirm deploy.

### AFTER a New Success Pattern
1. If a new approach was used for the first time and succeeded, **append a CONFIRMED entry**:
```
### YYYY-MM-DD — CATEGORY — ✅ Short Title (CONFIRMED WORKING)
**What:** Description of what was done
**Pattern:** Reusable rule
```

## Quick Reference (Most Critical Rules)

These 15 rules prevent 90% of failures. Check every one before deploying.

| # | Rule | Category |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | LIST_BRANCH uses `listBranches` — NEVER `filterListBranches` | WORKFLOW |
| 2 | `defaultBranch` must have `nextActionId` — empty `{}` causes 500 | WORKFLOW |
| 3 | ENUMERATION fields: `values: []` (array). MULTISTRING fields: `value:` (singular) | WORKFLOW |
| 4 | Match `operationType` to property type — ENUMERATION for dropdowns, MULTISTRING for text | WORKFLOW |
| 5 | Action type `0-3` (Create task) needs `tasks` scope — check portal scopes via deep_health_check first | WORKFLOW |
| 6 | Action types `0-9` (in-app notification) and `0-11` (rotate owner) cause silent 500s | WORKFLOW |
| 7 | Use Set Property `0-5` with `hubspot_owner_id` instead of rotate-to-owner `0-11` | WORKFLOW |
| 8 | Deal workflows: use `CONTACT_FLOW` + `dataSources` — NOT `PLATFORM_FLOW` with LIST_BRANCH | WORKFLOW |
| 9 | `nextAvailableActionId` must be a **string** equal to highest actionId + 1 | WORKFLOW |
| 10 | All workflow names must start with `[VD]` prefix | GENERAL |
| 11 | Pipeline names are auto-prefixed with `[VD]` — don't add it yourself | GENERAL |
| 12 | Use `0-8` (internal email notification) as alternative to `0-3` (create task) | WORKFLOW |
| 13 | Wrap filters in OR → AND → filters hierarchy, even for single conditions | WORKFLOW |
| 14 | `isEnabled` MUST be `false` on all deployed workflows | WORKFLOW |
| 15 | 3-second delay between workflow creations to avoid rate limits | WORKFLOW |
| 16 | Every level needs `type` field: enrollment=`LIST_BASED`, branches=`OR`/`AND`, filters=`PROPERTY`, operations=match `operationType`, actions=`SINGLE_CONNECTION` | WORKFLOW |
| 17 | Actions need `actionTypeVersion: 0` and `connection: {edgeType: "STANDARD", nextActionId: "X"}` for chaining | WORKFLOW |
| 18 | Date "set to today" → BEST: use `TIMESTAMP` with `EXECUTION_TIME` (rule 27). FALLBACK: `OBJECT_PROPERTY` with `hs_lastmodifieddate`. Static dates → epoch ms string. | WORKFLOW |
| 19 | Association enrollment: use `filterBranchType: "ASSOCIATION"` with `objectTypeId`, `associationTypeId`, `associationCategory` | WORKFLOW |
| 20 | EVENT_BASED enrollment (property change): use `eventFilterBranches` with `UNIFIED_EVENTS`, `hs_name`/`hs_value` pattern | WORKFLOW |
| 21 | Create Record (0-14): properties array with `targetProperty` + `value` objects. Supports STATIC_VALUE, OBJECT_PROPERTY, RELATIVE_DATETIME | WORKFLOW |
| 22 | Create Task (0-3): needs `task_type`, `subject`, `associations[]` with ENROLLED_OBJECT, `owner_assignment`, `priority`. Requires `tasks` scope | WORKFLOW |
| 23 | Date-Based Delay (0-35): `date` field uses OBJECT_PROPERTY, `delta` in minutes (negative = before date), `time_of_day` for specific hour | WORKFLOW |
| 24 | Event Wait (0-29): `event_filter_branches` with UNIFIED_EVENTS, `expiration_minutes` for timeout. Branch result via STATIC_BRANCH on `hs_event_criteria_met` | WORKFLOW |
| 25 | Set Property on associated object: add `association: { associationCategory, associationTypeId }` to 0-5 fields | WORKFLOW |
| 26 | Re-enrollment triggers: use `reEnrollmentTriggersFilterBranches` with `hs_name`/`hs_value` pattern (STRING + ENUMERATION operators) | WORKFLOW |
| 27 | **Date "set to NOW" — use `TIMESTAMP` type**: `"value": {"timestampType": "EXECUTION_TIME", "type": "TIMESTAMP"}`. This is BETTER than OBJECT_PROPERTY with hs_lastmodifieddate. | WORKFLOW |
| 28 | Custom object workflows: use `PLATFORM_FLOW`, custom `objectTypeId`, and `USER_DEFINED` association category in dataSources | WORKFLOW |
| 29 | Delete Object action: use portal-specific actionTypeId (not standard), `actionTypeVersion: 42`, empty fields, MUST be terminal (no connection) | WORKFLOW |
| 30 | Add/Remove from Static List: portal-specific actionTypeId, `actionTypeVersion: 3`, `list_id` + `operation: "ADD"/"REMOVE"` | WORKFLOW |
| 31 | Auto-Associate by Property Match: portal-specific actionTypeId, `actionTypeVersion: 6`, qualified property names `p{object_id}_{property}` | WORKFLOW |
| 32 | Copy Owner from Associated Object: actionTypeId `0-25`, copies `hubspot_owner_id` via association | WORKFLOW |
| 33 | MULTISTRING operators for text matching: `CONTAINS`, `CONTAINS_EXACTLY`, `DOES_NOT_CONTAIN` — use with `operationType: "MULTISTRING"` | WORKFLOW |
| 34 | FETCHED_OBJECT_PROPERTY value type: `"type": "FETCHED_OBJECT_PROPERTY"` with `propertyToken` for cross-object property references in email tokens | WORKFLOW |
| 35 | Refer to `docs/workflow-pattern-catalog-v2.md` for all 35+ enrollment, action, and branching patterns | GENERAL |

## Learnings Log

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — LIST_BRANCH uses `listBranches` not `filterListBranches`
**Trigger:** Deployed a workflow with if/then colour branching
**Failed because:** Used `filterListBranches` as the field name in LIST_BRANCH action
**Fix:** The correct field is `listBranches` — no "filter" prefix
**Pattern:** LIST_BRANCH action → always use `listBranches` array, never `filterListBranches`

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Empty defaultBranch causes "required fields not set"
**Trigger:** Deployed workflow with LIST_BRANCH and `defaultBranch: {}`
**Failed because:** HubSpot requires `nextActionId` inside `defaultBranch` even for the "else" path
**Fix:** Always include: `"defaultBranch": { "edgeType": "STANDARD", "nextActionId": "X" }` or point to a valid action
**Pattern:** defaultBranch must include `nextActionId` — empty `{}` causes 500 error

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — ENUMERATION vs MULTISTRING value format
**Trigger:** Deployed workflow with property filter for an enumeration field
**Failed because:** Used `value: "Blue"` (singular) instead of `values: ["Blue"]` (array) for ENUMERATION operationType
**Fix:** ENUMERATION → `values: ["a", "b"]` (array). MULTISTRING → `value: "text"` (singular string)
**Pattern:** Check property type FIRST: enum = `values[]`, string = `value`

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — PLATFORM_FLOW rejects LIST_BRANCH on deals
**Trigger:** Created deal-based workflow using `PLATFORM_FLOW` with `objectTypeId: "0-3"` and LIST_BRANCH branching
**Failed because:** LIST_BRANCH actions fail silently or return 500 when used in PLATFORM_FLOW deal workflows
**Fix:** Use `CONTACT_FLOW` with `objectTypeId: "0-1"` and add `dataSources` array to fetch associated deal data:
```json
{
  "type": "CONTACT_FLOW",
  "objectTypeId": "0-1",
  "dataSources": [{"type": "ASSOCIATED_OBJECTS", "objectTypeId": "0-3"}]
}
```
**Pattern:** Deal workflows with branching → CONTACT_FLOW + dataSources, never PLATFORM_FLOW

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Action type 0-3 (Create task) requires tasks scope
**Trigger:** Deployed workflow with Create task action (`0-3`) on the target portal
**Failed because:** Portal doesn't have `tasks` scope available via API
**Fix:** Use internal email notification (`0-8`) as alternative. Sends email to specified HubSpot users with subject and body.
```json
{
  "actionTypeId": "0-8",
  "fields": {
    "user_ids": ["{owner_id}"],
    "subject": "New Lead: {{ enrolled_object.firstname }} {{ enrolled_object.lastname }}",
    "body": "<ul><li>Email: {{ enrolled_object.email }}</li><li>Phone: {{ enrolled_object.phone }}</li></ul>"
  }
}
```
**Pattern:** On the target portal, replace Create task (0-3) with Internal email (0-8)

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Action types 0-9 and 0-11 cause silent 500 errors
**Trigger:** Attempted to use in-app notification (`0-9`) and rotate-to-owner (`0-11`) in workflows
**Failed because:** Both return HTTP 500 with no useful error message. HubSpot v4 API doesn't support these reliably.
**Fix:**
- Instead of `0-9` (in-app notification) → use `0-8` (internal email notification)
- Instead of `0-11` (rotate to owner) → use `0-5` (Set Property) with `hubspot_owner_id`
**Pattern:** Avoid 0-9 and 0-11 entirely. Use 0-8 for notifications, 0-5 for owner assignment.

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Owner assignment via Set Property
**Trigger:** Needed to assign contacts to specific owners based on colour preference
**Failed because:** Initially tried `0-11` rotate-to-owner which returned 500
**Fix:** Use Set Property (`0-5`) with `hubspot_owner_id`:
```json
{
  "actionTypeId": "0-5",
  "fields": {
    "property_name": "hubspot_owner_id",
    "value": { "staticValue": "{owner_id}", "type": "STATIC_VALUE" }
  }
}
```
Owner IDs: Fetch dynamically via `list_portals` → `portal_capabilities`
**Pattern:** Owner assignment → Set Property 0-5 on hubspot_owner_id with STATIC_VALUE

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Internal email notification with contact tokens
**Trigger:** Needed to notify owners about new leads with contact details
**Failed because:** First attempt didn't include contact detail tokens in the email body
**Fix:** Use HubSpot token syntax `{{ enrolled_object.PROPERTY }}` in subject and body:
```json
{
  "actionTypeId": "0-8",
  "fields": {
    "user_ids": ["{owner_id}"],
    "subject": "New Lead: {{ enrolled_object.firstname }} {{ enrolled_object.lastname }}",
    "body": "<h3>New Lead Assigned</h3><ul><li><strong>Name:</strong> {{ enrolled_object.firstname }} {{ enrolled_object.lastname }}</li><li><strong>Email:</strong> {{ enrolled_object.email }}</li><li><strong>Phone:</strong> {{ enrolled_object.phone }}</li></ul><p>Please follow up within 24 hours.</p>"
  }
}
```
**Pattern:** Use `{{ enrolled_object.propertyname }}` tokens in 0-8 email subject/body for dynamic contact data

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — IS_KNOWN requires operationType ALL_PROPERTY
**Trigger:** Tried to use `IS_NOT_EMPTY` or `HAS_PROPERTY` operator in enrollment criteria
**Failed because:** These operators don't exist in v4 API enrollment criteria
**Fix:** Use `IS_KNOWN` with `operationType: "ALL_PROPERTY"`:
```json
{
  "property": "favourite_colour",
  "operation": {
    "operator": "IS_KNOWN",
    "operationType": "ALL_PROPERTY"
  },
  "filterType": "PROPERTY"
}
```
**Pattern:** "Property has any value" → IS_KNOWN + ALL_PROPERTY. "Property is empty" → IS_UNKNOWN + ALL_PROPERTY

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Filter hierarchy must be OR → AND → filters
**Trigger:** Deployed workflow with flat filter structure (filters at root level)
**Failed because:** HubSpot v4 requires nested hierarchy even for single conditions
**Fix:** Always wrap in OR → AND → filters:
```json
{
  "filterBranchType": "OR",
  "filterBranches": [{
    "filterBranchType": "AND",
    "filters": [{ "property": "...", "operation": { ... } }]
  }]
}
```
**Pattern:** Even single conditions need OR wrapper → AND wrapper → filters array

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — Multiple LIST_BRANCH branches work in single action
**Trigger:** Previously chained single-branch LIST_BRANCH actions sequentially
**Failed because:** N/A — this was a cautious approach from early failures
**Fix:** Multiple `listBranches` entries in a single LIST_BRANCH action DO work. Tested successfully with 4 colour branches (Blue, Red, Purple, Green) in one action.
**Pattern:** Multi-branch LIST_BRANCH is supported — no need to chain single-branch actions

---

### 2026-03-18 — GENERAL — All workflow names must have [VD] prefix
**Trigger:** Created workflow without `[VD]` prefix in the name
**Failed because:** Violated Vero Digital naming convention for attribution tracking
**Fix:** Always prefix workflow names with `[VD]`: e.g., `[VD] Lead Router`, `[VD] Colour Assignment`
**Pattern:** Workflow names → always start with `[VD]`

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — nextAvailableActionId must be string type
**Trigger:** Set `nextAvailableActionId: 5` (integer) in workflow spec
**Failed because:** Engine validation rejects non-string values
**Fix:** Must be a string: `"nextAvailableActionId": "5"` — equal to highest actionId + 1
**Pattern:** nextAvailableActionId → always a string, always highest actionId + 1

---

### 2026-03-18 — GENERAL — No delete_workflow MCP tool available
**Trigger:** Attempted to delete test workflows programmatically
**Failed because:** No `delete_workflow` tool exists in the MCP toolset
**Fix:** Delete workflows manually through HubSpot UI: Automation → Workflows → select → delete
**Pattern:** Workflow deletion → manual only via HubSpot UI

---

### 2026-03-18 — WORKFLOW — ✅ Colour-based lead routing with notifications (CONFIRMED WORKING)
**What:** Full workflow: enrollment on `favourite_colour` IS_KNOWN → LIST_BRANCH with 4 branches (Blue/Red → {owner_a}, Purple/Green → {owner_b}) → Set owner via 0-5 → Internal email notification via 0-8 with contact tokens
**Pattern:** Complete lead routing pattern: IS_KNOWN enrollment → multi-branch LIST_BRANCH → Set Property owner → Internal email with {{ enrolled_object.X }} tokens

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — v4 API requires `type` field on filters, branches, actions, and enrollment
**Trigger:** Deploying deal-based workflow on a portal failed repeatedly with "required fields not set: [type]"
**Failed because:** The v4 API requires a `type` field at EVERY level of the workflow spec:
- `enrollmentCriteria.type` → must be `"LIST_BASED"`, `"EVENT_BASED"`, or `"MANUAL"`
- `listFilterBranch.type` → must match `filterBranchType` (e.g., `"OR"`)
- Each `filterBranch.type` → must match its `filterBranchType` (e.g., `"AND"`)
- Each `filter.type` → must be `"PROPERTY"` (AND keep `filterType: "PROPERTY"`)
- Each `operation.type` → must match `operationType` (e.g., `"ENUMERATION"`)
- Each `action.type` → must be `"SINGLE_CONNECTION"` for simple actions (0-5, 0-8), or `"LIST_BRANCH"`, `"STATIC_BRANCH"` etc for branching
**Fix:** Add `type` field at every level. Complete working pattern:
```json
{
  "enrollmentCriteria": {
    "type": "LIST_BASED",
    "listFilterBranch": {
      "type": "OR", "filterBranchType": "OR",
      "filterBranches": [{
        "type": "AND", "filterBranchType": "AND",
        "filters": [{
          "type": "PROPERTY", "filterType": "PROPERTY",
          "property": "prop_name",
          "operation": { "type": "ENUMERATION", "operator": "IS_ANY_OF", "operationType": "ENUMERATION", "values": ["true"] }
        }]
      }]
    }
  },
  "actions": [{ "type": "SINGLE_CONNECTION", "actionTypeId": "0-5", ... }]
}
```
**Pattern:** v4 API needs `type` at EVERY level — enrollment, branches, filters, operations, AND actions. Always include both `type` and the legacy field (`filterBranchType`, `filterType`, `operationType`).

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — Actions need `actionTypeVersion: 0` and `connection` object
**Trigger:** Deploying workflow with chained actions on Hub 2 failed with "Invalid request to flow creation"
**Failed because:** Actions used `nextActionId` at the top level instead of the `connection` object
**Fix:** Each action needs:
- `"actionTypeVersion": 0` — required field
- `"connection": { "edgeType": "STANDARD", "nextActionId": "X" }` — instead of top-level `nextActionId`
```json
{
  "type": "SINGLE_CONNECTION",
  "actionTypeId": "0-5",
  "actionId": "1",
  "actionTypeVersion": 0,
  "connection": { "edgeType": "STANDARD", "nextActionId": "2" },
  "fields": { ... }
}
```
**Pattern:** Always use `connection` object for chaining + `actionTypeVersion: 0` on every action

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — Date properties: use OBJECT_PROPERTY value type
**Trigger:** Tried to set `tcs_approved_date` to current date in a deal workflow
**Failed because:** `STATIC_VALUE` with `{{now}}`, ISO dates, and non-epoch strings all rejected. Only epoch ms as string works for static dates.
**Fix:** Two approaches work:
1. **Static date (epoch ms):** `{"type": "STATIC_VALUE", "staticValue": "1773890346945"}` — hardcoded, won't update
2. **Dynamic date (copy from property):** `{"type": "OBJECT_PROPERTY", "propertyName": "hs_lastmodifieddate"}` — copies the enrolled object's last modified date, which equals "now" at enrollment time
```json
{
  "type": "SINGLE_CONNECTION",
  "actionTypeId": "0-5",
  "actionId": "2",
  "actionTypeVersion": 0,
  "fields": {
    "property_name": "tcs_approved_date",
    "value": { "type": "OBJECT_PROPERTY", "propertyName": "hs_lastmodifieddate" }
  }
}
```
**Pattern:** For "set date to today" → use OBJECT_PROPERTY with hs_lastmodifieddate. For specific dates → use STATIC_VALUE with epoch ms string.

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — ✅ Deal workflow with boolean + date set property (CONFIRMED WORKING)
**What:** Deal PLATFORM_FLOW workflow triggered on `quote_signed = true`. Action 1: Set `t_c_s_approved = true` (STATIC_VALUE). Action 2: Set `tcs_approved_date` to `hs_lastmodifieddate` (OBJECT_PROPERTY). Both chained via `connection` objects with `actionTypeVersion: 0`.
**Pattern:** Complete deal property update pattern: LIST_BASED enrollment + SINGLE_CONNECTION actions + connection chaining + OBJECT_PROPERTY for dynamic dates

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — Association-based enrollment (Deal → Quote) with TIME_RANGED date filter
**Trigger:** User wanted "when quote is signed, update deal" — needed to enroll deals when an associated quote's ESign date is today
**Failed because:** Initial approach used `quote_signed` boolean property as trigger instead of checking the actual associated Quote object's ESign date
**Fix:** Use `filterBranchType: "ASSOCIATION"` to check associated objects. The correct enrollment structure:
```json
{
  "type": "LIST_BASED",
  "shouldReEnroll": true,
  "listFilterBranch": {
    "filterBranchType": "OR", "filterBranchOperator": "OR",
    "filterBranches": [{
      "filterBranchType": "AND", "filterBranchOperator": "AND",
      "filterBranches": [{
        "filterBranchType": "ASSOCIATION",
        "filterBranchOperator": "AND",
        "objectTypeId": "0-14",
        "operator": "IN_LIST",
        "associationTypeId": 63,
        "associationCategory": "HUBSPOT_DEFINED",
        "filterBranches": [],
        "filters": [{
          "property": "hs_esign_date",
          "filterType": "PROPERTY",
          "operation": {
            "operator": "IS_BETWEEN",
            "operationType": "TIME_RANGED",
            "type": "TIME_RANGED",
            "includeObjectsWithNoValueSet": false,
            "lowerBoundEndpointBehavior": "INCLUSIVE",
            "upperBoundEndpointBehavior": "EXCLUSIVE",
            "propertyParser": "VALUE",
            "lowerBoundTimePoint": {
              "timezoneSource": "CUSTOM",
              "zoneId": "Australia/Melbourne",
              "indexReference": { "referenceType": "TODAY" },
              "timeType": "INDEXED"
            },
            "upperBoundTimePoint": {
              "timezoneSource": "CUSTOM",
              "zoneId": "Australia/Melbourne",
              "indexReference": { "referenceType": "TODAY" },
              "offset": { "days": 1 },
              "timeType": "INDEXED"
            }
          }
        }]
      }],
      "filters": []
    }],
    "filters": []
  }
}
```
**Key fields:**
- `filterBranchType: "ASSOCIATION"` — checks properties on associated objects
- `objectTypeId: "0-14"` — Quotes object
- `associationTypeId: 63` — Deal-to-Quote association (HUBSPOT_DEFINED)
- `operator: "IN_LIST"` — "any associated quote matches"
- `TIME_RANGED` operation with `indexReference.referenceType: "TODAY"` — "date is today"
- `timeType: "INDEXED"` + `timezoneSource: "CUSTOM"` + `zoneId` — timezone-aware date comparison
- Upper bound uses `offset: { days: 1 }` to create a today-to-tomorrow exclusive range
**Pattern:** To enroll based on associated object properties: use ASSOCIATION filterBranch with objectTypeId, associationTypeId, associationCategory. For "date is today": use TIME_RANGED with IS_BETWEEN + TODAY referenceType + 1-day offset upper bound.

---

### 2026-03-19 — WORKFLOW — ✅ Complete Quote-Signed Deal Update (CONFIRMED WORKING — reverse-engineered from manual fix)
**What:** PLATFORM_FLOW deal workflow. Enrollment: Deal associated to any Quote where hs_esign_date is today (ASSOCIATION + TIME_RANGED). Actions: Set t_c_s_approved=true (STATIC_VALUE) → Set tcs_approved_date=hs_lastmodifieddate (OBJECT_PROPERTY). Re-enrollment enabled.
**Pattern:** For "when quote is signed → update deal": use ASSOCIATION enrollment on Quote (0-14) with TIME_RANGED date filter, NOT a boolean property trigger. This is the correct HubSpot pattern for quote-triggered deal workflows.
